Hi, I'm Asif! Taking a stroll at my corner of the internet? Have a look around ;)

I love reading [[Books]], spending time outdoors in the nature. And did I mention that I love animals too!? There was a time when I raised 50+ chickens at my backyard, they were my pets, super fun!

Right now I'm working to make customers successful at [Ona](https://ona.com) by leveraging AI Agents and loads of automation.

Have fun exploring!
