The hardest part about being a male, for me at least is that I have to put on a smile even when it feels like things are falling apart and I don't have the energy anymore. I'm not sure, but being someone who is just 20 years old with lots of responsibilities with lots of people around you expecting certain things from you, it does feel a little overwhelming. There's no time to relax, it feels like, which can also create scope for bad habits. And I'm just trying to realize this thing. I think I'm getting there, but it's hard.
