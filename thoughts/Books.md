Book are one of the many but an important medium that shapes my thoughts. I started reading extensively since the beginning of 2024, one of the best decisions I've made so far. Try this: Keep your book or kindle next to your pillow, also listen to audiobooks while doing something mundane. Below is a non-exhaustive list (in no order) of the books that I've read so far, or plan to read. My favorite ones are marked with a "ðŸŒŸ" emoji.

- ðŸŒŸ The Defining Decade (recommended by an amazing mentor ðŸ«¶)
- ðŸŒŸ A brief history of time
- ðŸŒŸ Project Hail Mary (highly recommend pairing with the Audiobook)
- ðŸŒŸ Atomic Habits
- The Beginning of Infinity
- ðŸŒŸ Murderbot Diaries (the show is epic too!)
- Deep Work
- ðŸŒŸ Call Me Maybe (Romance âœ¨)
- ðŸŒŸ Drop Dead (Romance âœ¨)
- Rich Dad Poor Dad
- ðŸŒŸ The Terminal List
- All Dead by T.W Brown
